# Fritz Mesh Info

## Why and what
I want to visualize the network topology of my FritzBox based home network.  
Here I try to use the TR-064 protocol to gather the information from the FritzBx and make sense out of it.

## Requirements
It requires php , php-soap an composer

## Install (why would you even do that?)
Clone or download a copy of this repo, cd into it, use  
``` composer install ```
and copy the config.php.dist file to config.php and change the settings.

## And now?

I just started that a few hours ago, so there's not really much yet.
